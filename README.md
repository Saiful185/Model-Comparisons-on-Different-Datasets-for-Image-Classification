# Model-Comparisons-on-Different-Datasets-for-Image-Classification
This is a Comparative Study of Image Classification on Different Types of Datasets Using Multiple Neural Network Architectures. This is a project for CSE 715 course. I tested different NN models for 4 popular image datasets:
1. MNIST
2. Fashion MNIST
3. CIFAR-10
4. CIFAR-100

The four notebooks represent the implementations for the four datasets. The paper(pdf) has all the analysis and details.
